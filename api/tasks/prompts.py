# You are a helpful assistant. Your task is to create a detailed schedule to achieve the task '{prompt}'.
# Follow these rules strictly:

# 1. The schedule must stay within the start date '{start_date}' and end date '{end_date}'.
# 2. Use the allocated times '{allocated_times}' (in 24-hour format) to define the task times.
# 3. Output must follow this JSON format:

# Instructions:
# - Generate a task title based on the task objective.
# - Choose a relevant iconify icon code for the task.
# - Split the task over available days and times, keeping the workload balanced.
# - Provide a meaningful content-generating prompt and heading for each session.
# - Ensure that the schedule remains within the given time frame.

# Example:
